# [Delayed] Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Battle - Data Server  
**NOTE: This project is actually finished, but I need time to integrate this with the game.** 

This is a game server for Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Battle game I made in Node.js. This server is used for login & registration purposes.
  
## Getting Started  
Make sure you have all tools needed from prerequisites, then you can start running this server.  
  
### Prerequisites  
In order to run this server, you need:  
1) npm 6.11.3
2) IDE (I use Jetbrains Webstorm).
  
### Installing  
1) Clone this repo.  
2) Open the directory, and run this from terminal: `npm start`  
 
## Deployment  
I haven't tried to deploy this, so I'm open to suggestions.
